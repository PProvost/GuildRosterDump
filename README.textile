h2. Overview

In patch 3.2.2 Blizzard removed the /saveguildroster function for security reasons. So if you have a large guild, or just want to keep a backup of your guild info, you will have no way of tracking your guild info or backing it up to off-realm storage.

This addon introduces a new slash command, /gdump, which addresses this need. When invoked it will pop up an edit box containing the guild roster info in tab-delimited (CSV) format for easy copy-paste into Excel or some other tool. It is very lightweight and uses almost no memory or saved variable space.

The format of the CSV data is as follows:

Name - Rank - Level - Class - Zone - Note - OfficerNote - LastOnline - Status

One record per line, TAB delimited. A header row is included. Just select, copy and paste into Excel.

IMPORTANT - Since patch 5.0.4, the on-screen editor might not show the TAB characters separating the columns, but they are still there. Just copy-paste it into your program (Excel, Notepad, whatever) and it will work.
